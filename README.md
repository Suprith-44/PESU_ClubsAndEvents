# PESU_ClubsAndEvents
## The PESU Integrated Clubs and Events Management system is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to unify the management of club recruitments and event registrations across the institution.
-  The platform consists of two distinct websites: one tailored for club administrators and the other for students.
-  Club administrators can log in to initiate recruitment drives, create and manage events, and handle event registrations efficiently.
-  Students, on the other hand, can explore clubs currently recruiting, view details of events organized by various clubs, apply for memberships, and register for events seamlessly.
-  This system significantly reduces dependency on traditional tools like Google Forms, providing a streamlined, centralized solution for managing club activities and events.
-  By integrating all clubs and events under a unified platform, the project enhances accessibility and transparency, making the process of applying to clubs and registering for events hassle-free for students.
-  Tech Stack: React, Flask, Sqlite3.
